{title:Description}
{pstd}
{cmd:bbandits_sim} simulates data for different multi-armed bandit algorithm. Currently it supports epsilon greedy
algorithm and Thompson sampling. {opt true_mean_values} are a numlist of the true expected values of each arm from
which the simulated data is drawn from. The option {opt greedy} specifies the epsilon greedy algrotihm. The option
{opt thompson} selects the Bernoulli Thompson algorithm. The default option is {opt greedy}. 

{pstd}
Under the {opt greedy} specification the algorithm uses simulated data from a normal distribution and applies the batched epsilon 
greedy algorithm. {opt true_mean_values} are a numlist of the true expected values of each arm from
which the simulated data is drawn from. The rewards for each arm are drawn
from a normal distribution with the given expected value and a standard deviation of 1. The first value 
is the expected value for the first arm, the second for the second and so on.  
The algorithm shows the data generating process of the batched epsilon greedy algorithm.

{pstd}
Under the {opt thompson} data is simulated from a Bernoulli Thompson algorithm. Thompson sampling only allows
probabilities as inputs. 

{pstd} The underlying algorithms are implemented in python, therefore a python installation
is necessary.

{marker options}{...}
{title:Options}
{phang}{opt b:atch(integer)} specifies the number of batches. The default is 25 batches.

{phang}{opt s:ize(integer)} specifies the batch size. The default is 100 observations per batch.

{phang}{opt e:ps(real)} specifies the epsilon parameter for the epsilon-greedy algorithm. The default epsilon is 10\%. 

{phang}{opt d:ecay(real)} defines the decay rate for the epsilon-greedy algorithm. At the moment only a linear decay rate which multiplies the epsilon from the previous round with the decay factor is implemented. The default value is 1.

{phang}{opt c:lipping(real)} specifies the clipping rate for the Bernoulli Thompson algorithm. The default value is 5\%.

{phang}{opt ex:ploration(int 0)} specifies the number of batches where the algorithm assigns the treatment uniformly. The default value is 0.

{phang}{opt g:reedy} specifies the epsilon-greedy algorithm instead of the Bernoulli-Thompson algorithm. The default is epsilon-greedy.

{phang}{opt standard_deviations(numlist)} specifies the standard deviations for the arms' rewards from the normal distribution under the epsilon greedy algorithm. 
For example, standard_deviations(1 2) sets the reward distribtuion for arm 1 to normal(mu1,1) and for arm 2 to normal(mu2,2).

{phang}{opt t:hompson} specifies the Bernoulli-Thompson sampling algorithm instead of the epsilon-greedy treatment assignment algorithm. 

{phang}{opt p:lot_thompson} generates plots of the beta distribution under the Thompson sampling algorithm.

{phang}{opt s:tacked} plots the beta distribution under the Thompson sampling algorithm but vertically stacked.

{phang}{opt m:onte_carlo} specifies that instead of simulating a single bbandits experiment, {opt N} bandits experiments
are conducted. Using the {opt monte_carlo} option the command returns the test statistic for the OLS and BOLS in
each of the N runs. Additionally, the distribution of the test statistics is plotted. With the option {opt thompson}
or {opt greedy} the respective algorithm for the simulation is chosen. The program might take a while to run. The default value is 1,000 repetitions. Only two arms can be compared to each other even if multiple arms are specified. 

{phang}{opt n(i:nteger)} specifies the number of repetitions for the Monte Carlo simulation.

{phang}{opt r:eference_arm(integer)} specifies the reference arm for the Monte Carlo simulation.

{phang}{opt arm(i:nteger)} specifies the arm which is compared against the reference arm in the Monte Carlo simulation. The Monte Carlo simulation function only allows to compute the test statistic for two arms but the data can be drawn from a multi-arm simulation.

{phang}{opt (tw:opts)} specifies twoway option for graphs.

{pstd}Setup

{phang2}{cmd:. bbandits_sim 1 2}

{pstd}Data is generated according to a batched epsilon greedy algorithm (default option). The rewards are drawn from
a normal Distribution with expected value 1 and standard deviation 1 (N(1,1)) for both arms.

{phang2}{cmd:. bbandits_sim 1 1 2, batch(10) size(100) eps(0.2) epsilon} 

{pstd} Three arms with expected mean values of 1, 1 and 2 are simulated and generated under the batched 
epsilon greedy algorithm (explicitly specified). There are 10 batches {cmd: batch} and in each batch 100 rewards {cmd: size} are drawn. In each batch 20
percent {cmd: eps} of the rewards are randomly drawn (exploration), 80 percent are drawn from the arm with the highest 
estimated expected value up to the respective batch (exploitation).

{phang2} {cmd:. bbandits_sim 0.1 0.15 0.2, batch(10) size(100) clipping(0.1) thompson} 

{pstd} Three arms drawn from a bernoulli distribution with the given probabilities. 

{phang2} {cmd:. bbandits_sim 0.5 0.5, monte_carlo thompson clipping(0.1) n(1000)} 

{pstd} Runs a simple Monte Carlo study for two arms with a zero margin. The specified algorithm is Bernoulli Thompson
Sampling. The clipping rate is 0.1 and 1000 trials will be simulated.

{phang2} {cmd:. bbandits_sim 1 1, monte_carlo greedy reference_arm(0) arm(1) test_value(0) n(500) eps(0.2) standard_deviations(1 2) tw(title("My Histogram Title"))} 

{pstd} Runs a simple Monte Carlo study for two arms with a zero margin. The specified algorithm is Epsilon greedy. The rewards are drawn from a normal distribution with mu1=mu2=1
and standard deviation 1 and 2.
